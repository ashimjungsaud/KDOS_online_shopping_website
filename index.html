        <p>
            I am Karma Dema, a 29-year-old from Bhutan and I am pursuing a Master's in Information Technology. With a
            keen interest
            in photography, i capture the beauty of both the digital world and the physical one. My academic journey is
            marked by a
            passion for technology and a commitment to mastering it. I determined to shine through the pursuit of higher
            education,
            reflecting a dedication to personal and professional growth. In a world where data and visuals coalesce, my
            IT skills
            and photography hobby blend seamlessly, enabling it not only understand but also artistically represent the
            evolving
            technological landscape. As I continue to learn and explore, I am poised to make a meaningful impact in the
            realms of
            technology and visual storytelling.
